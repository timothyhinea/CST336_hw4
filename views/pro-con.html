                <h2>Pros</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information Access - Anyone can remotely access a deviceâ€™s data 
                    because they are part of a network.</li>
                    <li>Communication - Since machinery is able to communicate with 
                    each other it substantially increases efficiency and produces better results.</li>
                    <li>Automation - Without the need for human intervention, the 
                    possibility of human error is dismal and results in a more streamlined service.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="cons">
                 <h2>Cons</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Privacy - Data shared over the network is 
                    not always secure and data can be intercepted.</li>
                    <li>Complexity - The biggest issue in IoT is 
                    how to connect all these devices as one mistake can ruin the system.</li>
                    <li>Lesser Jobs - Human labor will become 
                    redundant as fewer humans are needed to maintain service.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
